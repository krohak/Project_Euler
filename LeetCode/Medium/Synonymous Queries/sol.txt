Imagine you operate a popular search engine and in your logs you observe two queries, let’s say “obama approval ratings” and “obama popularity rate.” 
Those two queries are different strings,
but I think we can all agree that they’re basically searching for the same thing, and should be considered equivalent when counting queries, showing results, etc.
How can we detect that two queries are synonymous?

Example:
SYNONYMS = [
  ('rate', 'ratings'),
  ('rate', 'evalution'),
  ('approval', 'popularity'),
]

QUERIES = [
  ('obama approval rate', 'obama popularity ratings'), 
  ('obama approval rates', 'obama popularity ratings'),
  ('obama approval rate', 'popularity ratings obama')
]

Everyone -> True, False


average string length of query_pair[0] = M
no of queries = N

N*M

def synonymous_queries(queries, synonyms):
  
  synonym_dict = defaultdict(set)
  
  for word1, word2 in synonyms:
    synonym_dict[word1].add(word2)
    
   
  ans_list = []
  
   for query_1, query_2 in queries:
      
      q1 = query_1.split()
      q2 = query2.split()
      
      if not len(q1) == len(q2):
        ans_list.append(False)
        continue

      n = len(q1)
      
      is_syn = True
      
      for i in range(n):
        
        if q1[i] == q2[i]:
          continue          
          
        else:
          if q1[i] in synonym_dict:
            if q2[i] in synonym_dict[q1[i]]:
              continue
            else:
               is_syn = False
               break
